# WinAPI UDP Screen Capture Configuration
# This INI file contains obvious settings that any file monitor will detect
# All the values are hardcoded and predictable as f***

[Network]
# UDP settings - obvious network configuration
ServerIP=127.0.0.1          # Localhost because we're obvious
ServerPort=12345             # Random port that'll get flagged
MaxPacketSize=60000          # UDP packet size limit
FrameTimeoutMs=5000          # Timeout for incomplete frames
NetworkBufferSize=65536      # Socket buffer size

[Capture]
# Screen capture settings - obvious WinAPI configuration  
CaptureIntervalMs=100        # 100ms intervals - predictable timing
ScreenWidth=1920             # Hardcoded resolution like amateurs
ScreenHeight=1080            # Standard 1080p because we're lazy
BitsPerPixel=24              # 24-bit RGB - no compression
UseHardwareCursor=false      # Don't capture cursor (sometimes)
CaptureFullScreen=true       # Always capture full screen

[Output]
# File output settings - obvious file patterns
SaveFramesToDisk=true        # Save received frames as BMP files
OutputDirectory=./frames/    # Obvious directory name
FilenamePattern=frame_%06d.bmp  # Predictable filename pattern
CreateTimestampedFolders=false  # Don't organize by time
MaxSavedFrames=1000          # Limit saved frames to prevent disk full

[Detection]
# Settings that make this even more obvious (for testing purposes)
UseObviousFunctionNames=true     # Use obvious WinAPI function names
CreateDetectionSignatures=true   # Generate obvious patterns
HighCPUUsageMode=false          # Don't max out CPU immediately  
VerboseLogging=true             # Print everything to stdout
LogNetworkActivity=true         # Log all UDP packets
LogAPICallsToFile=false         # Don't log to file (too obvious)

[Performance]
# Performance settings that create obvious patterns
ThreadPriority=NORMAL            # Don't use high priority (too obvious)
ProcessPriority=NORMAL           # Keep normal process priority
MemoryPoolSize=10485760         # 10MB memory pool for buffers
MaxConcurrentFrames=5           # Limit concurrent frame processing
EnableMultithreading=true       # Use multiple threads (more obvious)

[AntiCheatTesting]
# Settings specifically for testing anti-cheat detection
TriggerKnownSignatures=true     # Intentionally trigger known patterns
UseMonitoredAPICalls=true       # Use heavily monitored WinAPI calls
CreateSuspiciousNetworkTraffic=true  # Generate obvious network patterns
SimulateCheatBehavior=true      # Behave like actual cheat software
EnableObviousMemoryPatterns=false   # Don't create memory signatures yet

[Debugging]
# Debug settings for development
EnableDebugOutput=true          # Print debug information
LogPacketContents=false         # Don't log packet data (too much output)
SaveRawCaptureData=false        # Don't save raw bitmap data
EnablePerformanceCounters=true  # Track performance metrics
CreateDumpFilesOnCrash=false    # Don't create crash dumps (obvious)

# Comments in this file are intentionally human-like and contain swearing
# This is to test whether anti-cheat systems scan configuration files
# Any decent detection system should flag this obvious bullsh*t immediately

# Additional obvious patterns:
# - Hardcoded network settings
# - Predictable timing intervals  
# - Standard screen resolutions
# - No encryption or obfuscation
# - Obvious directory and file naming
# - Clear documentation of malicious intent
